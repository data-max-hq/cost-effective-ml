## Building the hybrid Kubernetes Cluster
![1-setup.png](diagrams/images/1-setup.png)

## ToDo:
1. Create two nodes and add them in cluster
2. Enable dashboard
3. Add nodes in separate node groups
4. Install kubeflow pipelines
5. Run sample tasks in separate node groups (taints and tolerations)
6. Install Ray and run ray tasks from Kubeflow
7. Enable Ray dashboard
8. Do the same with GPU nodes
